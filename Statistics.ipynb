    "Statistical inference is the process of using data analysis to deduce properties of an underlying distribution of probability.[1] Inferential statistical analysis infers properties of a population, for example by testing hypotheses and deriving estimates. It is assumed that the observed data set is sampled from a larger population.\n",
    "\n",
    "Statistical inference makes propositions about a population, using data drawn from the population with some form of sampling. Given a hypothesis about a population, for which we wish to draw inferences, statistical inference consists of (first) selecting a statistical model of the process that generates the data and (second) deducing propositions from the model."

    "In statistics, a population is a set of similar items or events which is of interest for some question or experiment.[1] A statistical population can be a group of existing objects (e.g. the set of all stars within the Milky Way galaxy) or a hypothetical and potentially infinite group of objects conceived as a generalization from experience (e.g. the set of all possible hands in a game of poker).[2] A common aim of statistical analysis is to produce information about some chosen population.[3\n",
    "\n",
    "In statistical inference, a subset of the population (a *statistical sample*) is chosen to represent the population in a statistical analysis.[4] The ratio of the size of this statistical sample to the size of the population is called a sampling fraction. It is then possible to estimate the population parameters using the appropriate sample statistics.\n",

When conceived as a data set, a sample is often denoted by capital roman letters such X and Y, with its elements expressed in lower-case and the sample size denoted by the letter n"
